# Vijay Sadashivaiah

I&rsquo;m a [Research Associate](https://www.libd.org/team/vijay-sadashivaiah/) at the [Lieber Institute for Brain Development](https://www.libd.org/), deciphering the neural and genetic pathways involved in Schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. I received a Bachelors degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering (a.k.a Electrical Engineering) from [PES University](https://pes.edu) and a Masters degree in Biomedical Engineering from the [Johns Hopkins University](https://jhu.edu). As a Research Assistant at the [Institute for Computational Medicine](https://icm.jhu.edu), I worked with [Dr. Sridevi Sarma](https://www.bme.jhu.edu/faculty_staff/sridevi-v-sarma-phd/) to study the underlying neural mechanisms of action in electrical stimulation therapies for chronic pain.
                                    
Before coming to Hopkins, I spent a summer at [École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne](https://epfl.ch), where I worked with [Dr. Carl Petersen](https://people.epfl.ch/carl.petersen/bio?lang=en&cvlang=en) to study the neural circuits involved in goal directed sensorimotor transformations. This is my [NeuroTree](https://neurotree.org/neurotree/tree.php?pid=184853). My Erdős number is [4](https://www.csauthors.net/distance/vijay-sadashivaiah/paul-erdos).

I was born in [Bangalore, India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore) but spent most of my time growing up in [Tumkur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumkur). I enjoy rock climbing, hiking and backpacking. I've hiked (or climbed or backpacked) in Hawaii, South Korea, Switzerland, India and mainland USA.

## Philosophy

Human brain is a complex connectome of neurons talking to each other with electrical impulses. While my ancestors from India believed the brain to be a god's creation, I consider it as a complex system that helps us with everyday activities. The "creator" made it so complex that we hardly understand how the simplest of tasks work. Forget human brain, we are decades away from fully understanding a mouse brain. I seek to understand how our physical world (e.g., our bodies, our brains), interacts with the mental worlds (e.g., our perceptions, experiences, memories, thoughts, emotions, psychiatric conditions). I want to contribute to this endeavor through computational modeling and data analysis. I strongly believe in reproducible research, so all my codes are available on [github](https://github.com/vjysd).
