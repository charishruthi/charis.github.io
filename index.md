# Vijay Sadashivaiah

I&rsquo;m a [Staff Scientist](https://www.libd.org/team/vijay-sadashivaiah/) at the [Lieber Institute for Brain Development](https://www.libd.org/), where I&rsquo;m integrating large-scale, heterogeneous datasets to extract relevant biomarkers pertaining to neuro-developmental disorders. Particularly, I&rsquo;m exploring novel data-driven methods to analyze imaging, genetic and physiological data to identify the underlying biological pathways involved in Schizophrenia and Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. I received a Bachelors degree in Electrical Engineering from the [PES Institute of Technology](https://pes.edu) and a Masters degree in Biomedical Engineering from the [Johns Hopkins University](https://jhu.edu). For my Master&rsquo;s thesis, I worked at the [Institute for Computational Medicine](https://icm.jhu.edu), with [Dr. Sridevi Sarma](https://www.bme.jhu.edu/faculty_staff/sridevi-v-sarma-phd/) to study the underlying neural mechanisms of action in electrical stimulation therapies for chronic pain.
                                    
Before coming to Hopkins, I spent a summer at [École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne](https://epfl.ch), where I worked with [Dr. Carl Petersen](https://people.epfl.ch/carl.petersen/bio?lang=en&cvlang=en) to study the neural circuits involved in goal directed sensorimotor transformations. This is my [NeuroTree](https://neurotree.org/neurotree/tree.php?pid=184853). 

My Erdős number is [4](https://www.csauthors.net/distance/vijay-sadashivaiah/paul-erdos).

I was born in [Bangalore, India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore) but spent most of my time growing up in [Tumkur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumkur). I enjoy rock climbing, hiking and backpacking. I've hiked (or climbed or backpacked) in Hawaii, South Korea, Switzerland, India and mainland USA.

## Philosophy

Human body is a complex network of cells that are interacting with each other. While my ancestors from India believed the body to be a god's creation, I consider it as a complex system that helps us with everyday activities. I seek to understand how our physical world (e.g., our bodies, our brains), interacts with the mental worlds (e.g., our perceptions, experiences, memories, thoughts, emotions, psychiatric conditions). I want to contribute to this endeavor through computational modeling and data analysis. I strongly believe in reproducible research, so all my codes are available on [github](https://github.com/vjysd).
