# Vijay Sadashivaiah

I&rsquo;m a [Research Associate](https://www.libd.org/team/vijay-sadashivaiah/) at the [Lieber Institute for Brain Development](https://www.libd.org/). I received a Bachelors degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering (a.k.a Electrical Engineering) from [PES University](https://pes.edu) and a Masters degree in Biomedical Engineering from [Johns Hopkins University](https://jhu.edu). As a Research Assistant at the [Institute for Computational Medicine](https://icm.jhu.edu), I worked on computational modeling and data analysis of mammalian nerve fiber with [Dr. Sridevi Sarma](https://sarmalab.icm.jhu.edu/people/sridevi-sarma-pi/).
                                    
Before coming to Hopkins, I spent a summer at [École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne](https://epfl.ch), where I worked on neural circuits involved in goal directed sensorimotor transformations with [Dr. Carl Petersen](https://people.epfl.ch/carl.petersen/bio?lang=en&cvlang=en). During my junior year, I was a visiting student at [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](http://web.mit.edu/), where I worked on ultra-fast imaging with [Dr. Ramesh Raskar](http://raskar.info). This is my [NeuroTree](https://neurotree.org/neurotree/tree.php?pid=184853). 

I was born in [Bangalore, India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore) but spent most of my time growing up in [Tumkur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumkur). I enjoy rock climbing, hiking and backpacking. I've hiked (or climbed or backpacked) in Hawaii, South Korea, Switzerland, India and mainland USA.

## Philosophy

Human brain is a complex connectome of neurons. While my ancestors believed it as a god's creation, I consider it as a complex system helping us with everyday activities. The "creator" made it so complex that we hardly understand how the simplest of tasks work. Forget human brain, we are decades away from comprehending a mouse brain. I seek to understand how our physical world (e.g., our bodies, our brains), interacts with the mental worlds (e.g., our perceptions, experiences, memories, thoughts, emotions, psychiatric conditions). I want to contribute to this endeavor through computational modelling and data analysis. I strongly believe in reproducible research, so all my are available on [github](https://github.com/vjysd).
