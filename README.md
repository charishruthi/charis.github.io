I moved my site from html 5UP to Jekyll. It uses jekyll engine to generate html files from markdown files. I migration was simple, thanks to posts by [Jonathan McGlone](http://jmcglone.com/). Special thanks to Tristan Swedish since I used his [site](https://web.media.mit.edu/~tswedish/) for reference.
